                            The easy ship is the service offered by Amazon to sellers to ship their products to customers. You can opt for this service and can get rid of the shipping tension. All that needs to be done from your side is, you are just require to pack the parcel and schedule the time to handover to the delivery person. The delivery person will come to receive the parcel at the date and time slot you have chosen to hand over the parcel.

                                Selling Price (SP)  = Cost Price (CP) + ({Amazon referral fee + Fixed Closing Fee + Easy Ship Fee} +18% GST) + GST to be paid to government
                                <br><br>Let say we want to sell a product in category “Accessories – Electronic, PC and Wireless” which have a commission rate of  16.5%.

                                Let cost price of item = INR 250 (Includes input GST + Transportation charges to buy it + Storage charge to kept it)

                                Referral fee charged on referral fee = 550 * 16.5/ 100 = INR 90.75

                                Fixed closing fee charged  = INR 20 ( in case of (Easy Ship) excl. easy ship prime)

                                Dimension  = 20 cm * 20 cm * 10 cm

                                Volumetric weight = 20*20*10/5 = 4000/5 = 800 gms

                                Volumetric weight is greater than actual weight. So, Volumetric weight will be used to calculate the charges.

                                Amazon Fee Charged = 90.75 + 20 + 67 = INR 177.75

                                GST on Amazon Fee Charged = 177.75*18/100 = INR 31.95 { Can be claimed while filing GST return}
                                <br><br>
                                Total Amazon Fee Charged = 177.75 + 31.95 = INR 209.74
                                <br><br>Let say GST to be paid  = 12%

                                Profit = Selling Price – Cost Price – Amazon Fees Charged – GST = 550 – 250 – 209.74 – 66= INR 30.26
                                <br><br>
                                Note  – GST charged on amazon fee as well as on the cost price can be claimed while filing GST monthly return.
                                <br><br>
                                So Net Profit = 30.26 (Profit) + 31.95 (GST on Amazon Fee charged) + 26.78 (GST on Cost Price) = INR 88.99

                                <br>*Return cost will be generally taken as 2% of the selling price.
                                <br>*Packaging cost will be generally taken in range (INR 20 – INR 50) depending upon the type of item and material you have used.

                            <li>Electronic Transactions – It includes payments of al the orders which are paid using Credit Card/Debit Card/Net Banking etc.</li>

                            <li>Once you click on it there are two payment modes as discussed above “COD” and “Electronic”.</li>

                            Now you can see the statement view. You can select the date range (in weeks) to view the statement view of that particular week. By default the current week is selected.

                        <p>
                            The statement will show your <span style="color: #3232ff;">Beginning Balance</span> (Remaining balance of the previous week). This balance is held to refund the customer in case a return request will be generated. Other things which are included are <span style="color: #3232ff;">product charges, amazon fees, TCS, amazon easy ship charges, refunds,</span> etc. At the bottom, you can view the closing balance which will be transferred to you in the next settlement date.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Under the payments, you can also view <span style="color: #3232ff;">the Transaction View</span> for each order. Every transaction related to every order can be seen in the transaction view.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
