                        <p>
                            Recent years have seen an exceptional evolution in the way <span style="color: #3232ff;">India trades and shops</span>. E-commerce is one of the rapidly growing sectors, stimulating an entire generation of entrepreneurs, large scale manufacturing of <span style="color: #3232ff;">small and medium-sized enterprises</span>. E-commerce has enabled helped reduce barriers and bring the manufacturer closer to the customer. The presence of a virtual store on <span style="color: #3232ff;">e-commerce websites has helped millions of business flourish in India</span> and has led to more employment opportunities as well.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Today, <span style="color: #3232ff;">technology has advanced</span> at a rapid pace and with the use of smart phones, the online shopping experience has become seamless for customers. With easy to use mobile apps with elaborate store catalogs, <span style="color: #3232ff;">e-commerce</span> has ushered new opportunities for both traders and consumers.
                        </p><br>


                        <br>
                        <h2 style="color: darkblue;">
                            1. Amazon
                        </h2><br>
                        
                        <p>
                            Amazon is one of the <span style="color: #3232ff;">biggest online stores with a global presence</span>. It not only provides a variety of product choices but also provides a great user experience and splendid customer service. Besides putting prominence to personalization, Amazon also monitors user’s <span style="color: #3232ff;">browsing and purchase patterns</span> in order to provide them recommended products for future purchases. It operates in India as a marketplace rather than a retailer.
                            <br><br>Amazon has started two new initiatives for sellers in India: the <span style="color: #3232ff;">‘Self Service Registration (SSR)’ and ‘Amazon Easy Ship’.</span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Amazon SSR allows <a href="https://amzn.in/ehQDFgR">sellers to self register</a> in <span style="color: #3232ff;">Amazon marketplace, irrespective of location and size of the catalog</span>. It enables sellers to start selling within a day without any third party intervention. With <span style="color: #3232ff;">Amazon Easy Ship, the seller has to pack the shipment and confirm</span> to Amazon that they are ready to ship. Amazon Logistics ensures that the pack is delivered to the customers within two to three working days. With new features such as Amazon Prime, customers can receive delivery of products <span style="color: #3232ff;">within 24 hours</span>. By reducing the shipping time, Amazon keeps both retailers and customers happy and increases customer stickiness on the website.
                            <br><br>Right from <span style="color: #3232ff;">mobile phones, to fashion products, electrical appliances, books, and grocery, Amazon has become a one-stop shop</span> for all consumer needs.

                            2. Flipkart
                        </h2><br>
                        
                        <p>
                            Flipkart is an <span style="color: #3232ff;">Indian based e-commerce venture and over the years</span>, it has garnered a lot of interest in the minds of Indian consumers. It has opened up the scope for Indian e-tail market in a tremendous way. It started out as an online bookstore and now it has a gamut of products ranging from: <span style="color: #3232ff;">books, apparels, electronics, digital music, home care and beauty. Moreover</span>, it has now become a mega marketplace.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Flipkart’s fundamental differentiator is its supply chain efficiency— definitive delivery of goods. It has been continuously developing and improving the customer experience. The <span style="color: #3232ff;">website is easy to browse, hassle-free, and convenient.</span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Two of the most important reasons for <span style="color: #3232ff;">Flipkart’s grand success</span> are the discounts and the option of Cash- on- Delivery which makes consumers more confident in purchasing products. Flipkart has an amazing customer retention rate with <span style="color: #3232ff;">70% of repeat customers.</span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Apart from the shopping experience, <span style="color: #3232ff;">Flipkart’s biggest online shopping festival – Big Billion Days is one of the most successful campaigns and it churns out millions</span> of orders during that shopping season.
                        </p><br>

                            3. Jabong
                        </h2><br>
                        <p>
                            Jabong came into the e-commerce market with a bang and created a revolution within 6 to 7 months of launch. Besides selling products on their own through inventories, Jabong is also an <span style="color: #3232ff;">online marketplace for third-party sellers</span>. They predominantly cater to apparel, footwear, jewelry, and accessories and catalog more than 50,000 products across 700 brands.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Jabong is known for its own logistics network that ensures fast delivery. If you are in a city like Delhi, you are bound to receive the <span style="color: #3232ff;">product within 24 hours of order placement.</span> Jabong is also trying to expand its international presence through its site ‘JabongWorld.com’. It ships Indian products to international customers.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            One of Jabong’s uniqueness lies in its new idea of a <span style="color: #3232ff;">fashion magazine— “The Juice”</span> an interesting blend of fashion, people, trends and pop culture. The magazine has everything in it that readers would love to read in a fashion magazine. Jabong has also <span style="color: #3232ff;">collaborated with films such as “Bhaag Milkha Bhaag”, “Main Tera Hero”, and “Humpty Sharma ki Dulhaniya”</span> to offer exclusive products inspired by the movie.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The various payment gateways offered by Jabong have made it convenient for consumers to order products from the website. In 2016, Jabong was acquired by Myntra.

                            4. Snapdeal
                        </h2><br>
                        <p>
                            Snapdeal is a successful e-commerce portal catering to customer’s buying needs at a much wider aspect. It was established with a concept of making products available to the customers at a <span style="color: #3232ff;">discounted rate through offers and Snapdeal coupons.</span>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>

It has adopted the marketplace business model. Snapdeal came up with a unique idea of permitting local vendors and manufacturers to publish their product catalog and sell it on the Snapdeal portal. This avoids expensive costs involved in building own inventory.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Snapdeal’s business model was awarded with mammoth funding to scale up their products, business and operations. It <span style="color: #3232ff;">focuses on logistics and efficient delivery to customers.</span>  It operates in such a fast pace that a new product is added in every 30 seconds.
                        </p><br>

                        </h2><br>
                        <p>
                            Myntra is one of the largest shopping e-tailers in fashion and lifestyle merchandise. It supplies a wide range of products from clothing to footwear and accessories.

                            PayTm is the second largest e-commerce platform in India and has also made its way to the list of unicorn startups. <span style="color: #3232ff;">Primarily started as a mobile wallet, in 2016,</span> PayTm entered the e-commerce industry with PayTm Mall.

                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            One of the attractive features of PayTm has been its cashback feature. Consumers are given a variety of discount coupons to chose from and also provide good savings on the <span style="color: #3232ff;">purchase of goods</span>. With close to 120 million buyers on the platform, PayTm Mall is finding new ways to enhance the buying experience.

                        </p><br><br>
