                            New sellers start off as tier 2 sellers. After operating for a month and on fulfilling 30 transactions they can move to tier 1 level. The customer complaint settlement rate also determines to position and if a tier 1 seller defaults he could be downgraded to tier 2. Tier 1 sellers get payment earlier, <span style="color: #3232ff;">within 5 days</span> from dispatch whereas tier 2 sellers get payment in 10 days after dispatch. In any case, they have to follow a set of rules for order fulfillment.

In the standard delivery mode, a shipper must pack and keep items prepared using materials supplied by Flipkart, carrying the Flipkart logo.
